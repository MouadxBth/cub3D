# Cub3d 

>_Our first RayCaster with miniLibX_

<p>This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Our goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.</p>

## Goals

<p>This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.</p>

<p>As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.</p>

<p>To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.</p>

<p>With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.</p>
